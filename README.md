# Getting Started with Create React App

I created a repository in GitHub,

I cloned it,
I created a new react project,then I downgraded from react version 18 to react version 17
then npm i to update the packages,
I installed react router dom 5 in order to be able to route the pages
I created a folder components where I started to build the components for the project, created a login component,register component(just in case)

I never done to register a user without using Database, I was trying to implement it using the local storage
